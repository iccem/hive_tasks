Task 1
Hive Project Description: Log Analysis and Data Processing

Objective:
This project involves the development of Hive scripts to create and manage five tables for the analysis and processing of user logs. The tables include four external tables based on raw data and a fifth table partitioned by dates, with each partition representing a day.

Raw Data Description:
The raw data consists of user logs stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The data is organized into three parts, each residing in its subdirectory. The log entries vary in the number and type of columns, separated by tab ('\t') or space characters.

Table Specifications:

A. User Query Logs (user_logs):

IP address of the querying user (STRING),
Timestamp of the query (TIMESTAMP or INT),
HTTP request details (STRING),
Size of the transmitted page to the client (INT),
HTTP status code (INT).
Information about the client application used for the query, including browser details (STRING).
B. User Information (user_data):

IP address (STRING),
User's browser (STRING),
Gender (STRING) //male, female,
Age (INT).
C. IP Address Location Information (ip_data):

IP address (STRING),
Region (STRING).
Implementation:
The Hive script generates the four external tables based on the raw user log data. Additionally, it creates a partitioned table based on dates, with each partition corresponding to a day. This structure facilitates efficient querying and analysis of user interactions with news messages.

Note: This project showcases the utilization of Hive for data processing, table creation, and partitioning to derive meaningful insights from user logs stored in HDFS. It encompasses the extraction of relevant information such as user queries, user details, and IP address locations for further analysis.


Task 2
Hive Project Description: This project involves a Hive script that executes a query to retrieve the count of visits for each day. The obtained results are then sorted in descending order.

Objective:
This project involves a Hive script that executes a query to retrieve the count of visits for each day. The obtained results are then sorted in descending order.

Details:
The Hive script encompasses a specific query designed to aggregate and display the visit counts per day. The results of this query are subsequently organized in a descending order, providing a clear overview of the daily visit statistics.

Implementation:
The script utilizes Hive, a data warehousing and SQL-like query language for Hadoop, to efficiently process and analyze data related to visit counts on a daily basis. The sorting of results aids in presenting the information in a structured and easily interpretable manner.

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Execute the Hive script to run the specified query.
Review the output containing the sorted count of visits for each day.
This project serves as an illustration of utilizing Hive for data analysis tasks, providing valuable insights into daily visit patterns.

Note: This description outlines a Hive project focused on analyzing daily visit counts through a specific script. The use of Hive facilitates efficient querying and sorting of the obtained results, contributing to a better understanding of visit patterns.


Task 3
Hive Project Description: Hive Query for Gender-Based Visit Analysis

Objective:
This GitHub project focuses on a Hive script that executes a query to select the count of visits categorized by gender and region.

Details:
The script includes a specialized Hive query designed to aggregate and distinguish visit counts based on gender and regional information. The output provides a comprehensive breakdown of visit statistics, allowing for a nuanced analysis of user engagement from both male and female perspectives across different regions.

Implementation:
Utilizing Hive, a powerful data warehousing tool for Hadoop, the script efficiently processes and analyzes user visit data. The gender-based categorization, coupled with regional segmentation, offers valuable insights into the diversity of user engagement patterns.

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Execute the Hive script to run the gender-specific query.
Review the output containing the count of visits categorized by gender and region.
This project serves as a practical example of leveraging Hive for insightful data analysis, with a focus on understanding user engagement patterns based on gender and geographical regions.

Note: This description outlines a Hive project centered around gender-based visit analysis through a dedicated script. The use of Hive enhances the ability to discern patterns and trends in user engagement, providing a deeper understanding of audience behavior.


Task 4 - User Database Update for Domain Migration

Objective:
This GitHub project encompasses a Hive script designed to address Task 4, focusing on updating the user database following the migration of all tracked websites to the .com domain.

Details:
The script is tailored to efficiently update the user database, ensuring that all URLs now point to the new .com domain. This migration is a crucial step in maintaining data accuracy and aligning the user database with the recent changes in the domain structure of tracked websites.

Implementation:
Leveraging Hive, a powerful data warehousing and SQL-like query language for Hadoop, the script performs the necessary updates to reflect the domain migration. The transition to the .com domain is seamlessly executed, minimizing disruptions to the functionality of the user database.

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Execute the Hive script to initiate the database update process.
Confirm the successful migration by reviewing the updated URLs in the user database.
This project serves as a practical solution for ensuring the accuracy and relevance of user data following a domain migration, demonstrating effective use of Hive in database management.

Note: This description outlines a Hive project specifically addressing Task 4, focusing on updating the user database after the migration of tracked websites to the .com domain. The script utilizes Hive's capabilities to streamline the process and maintain data integrity.


Task 5 - Query Optimization with TABLESAMPLE

Objective:
The goal of this project is to optimize data processing for scenarios with vast datasets, leveraging TABLESAMPLE functionality. Specifically, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the query implemented in Task 3 by incorporating sampling techniques. Additionally, we explore various sampling percentages relative to the total dataset volume and assess the accuracy of resulting estimates. The project includes a comparative analysis of estimation precision based on different sampling percentages, visualized on a graph. Multiple metrics can be utilized for accuracy evaluation, either considering average values across regions or individual regions.

Implementation:

Original Query Optimization:

Begin by refining the query from Task 3 to enhance processing speed.
Identify key areas for optimization to streamline the overall data processing pipeline.
Integrate TABLESAMPLE:

Implement TABLESAMPLE functionality in the query to introduce sampling for faster data processing.
Experiment with different sampling percentages to assess the impact on query performance and accuracy of estimates.
Metrics for Accuracy:

Define suitable metrics for accuracy assessment. This may involve considering variations in estimation precision across regions.
Metrics could include mean absolute error, root mean square error, or other relevant measures.
Graphical Representation:

Utilize a graphical representation, such as a chart or graph, to illustrate the comparative results of different sampling percentages.
Provide visual insights into the trade-off between processing speed and estimation accuracy.
Usage:

Clone the repository.
Explore the SQL script containing the optimized query with TABLESAMPLE.
Execute the query with varying sampling percentages to observe the impact on estimation accuracy.
Visualize the results using the provided graphing tools.
This project serves as an exploration of query optimization through TABLESAMPLE in scenarios with extensive datasets. The focus is on achieving a balance between processing speed and estimation accuracy.
